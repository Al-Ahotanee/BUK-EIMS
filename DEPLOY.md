# Deploying BUK EIMS to Render + Neon

**BUK EIMS** is the Bayero University Kano Exam Incident Management System. This package is a PHP 8.2 + Apache application with a PostgreSQL database layer and React/Tailwind interfaces loaded through CDN assets.

> The application is suitable for an academic demonstration or controlled pilot. Before using it for live disciplinary records, replace the demo credentials, configure persistent evidence storage, review institutional retention rules, and complete a security assessment.

## 1. Technology stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Web server | Apache 2.4 inside the official PHP 8.2 Apache image |
| Backend | PHP 8.2 with PDO and PostgreSQL (`pdo_pgsql`) |
| Frontend | React 18 through Babel Standalone CDN and Tailwind CSS CDN |
| Icons and charts | Font Awesome CDN and Chart.js CDN |
| Database | PostgreSQL, recommended through Neon |
| Hosting | Render Docker Web Service or any Docker-capable PHP host |
| Branding | Bayero University Kano blue, navy, gold, and warm-neutral UI system |

## 2. Required files and environment variable

The application expects one environment variable:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require
```

`db.php` reads this connection string, creates the application schema idempotently on the first request, creates the timestamp trigger, and seeds the demonstration accounts. No manual SQL migration is required for a fresh deployment.

## 3. Deploy with Neon and Render Blueprint

### Step 1: Create the PostgreSQL database

Create a project at [Neon](https://neon.tech/), create or select a database, and copy its pooled PostgreSQL connection string. Keep the connection string private.

### Step 2: Push the source to GitHub

Create a private repository and push the contents of this folder, including `Dockerfile`, `docker-entrypoint.sh`, `render.yaml`, `db.php`, `api.php`, the PHP portal files, `assets/buk-logo.png`, and the `uploads` directory.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Brand application for Bayero University Kano"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/YOUR_PRIVATE_REPOSITORY.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create the Render service

In Render, choose **New → Blueprint**, select the repository, and allow Render to read `render.yaml`. The blueprint creates a Docker web service named `buk-eims`.

In the service’s **Environment** settings, add:

```text
DATABASE_URL = your Neon pooled connection string
```

Deploy the service. Render builds the Docker image, installs PostgreSQL support, starts Apache on the port supplied by Render, and exposes the application URL.

### Step 4: Open the application

Visit the Render URL and confirm that the Bayero University Kano crest, BUK EIMS name, blue-and-gold theme, landing page, and login screen appear correctly. The first login request initializes the database schema and demonstration records.

## 4. Local Docker deployment

Docker is the most reliable local test path because it matches the production PHP and Apache environment.

```bash
docker build -t buk-eims .
docker run --rm -p 8080:10000 \
  -e PORT=10000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require" \
  buk-eims
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To use a local PostgreSQL container instead of Neon, create a PostgreSQL database, then pass its connection string through `DATABASE_URL`. The application will create its own tables on first request.

## 5. Local PHP development without Docker

PHP 8.2 or newer and the PostgreSQL PDO extension are required.

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in the shell before starting PHP:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require"
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

This server is for development only. Use Apache or another production-grade web server for deployment.

## 6. Demonstration accounts

The database bootstrap creates these demonstration accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| System Administrator | `admin@buk.edu.ng` | `Admin@1234` |
| Exam Officer | `officer@buk.edu.ng` | `Officer@1234` |
| Invigilator | `invigilator@buk.edu.ng` | `Invigi@1234` |
| HOD / Dean | `hod@buk.edu.ng` | `Hod@12345` |
| Committee Member | `committee@buk.edu.ng` | `Commit@1234` |

These credentials are intended only for demonstration. Change or disable them before importing real university data. Do not expose them in a public repository or production environment.

## 7. Persistent evidence storage

The `uploads/` directory stores incident evidence files. Render’s free container filesystem is ephemeral, so files can disappear after a restart or redeploy. For a real pilot, replace local file storage in `api.php` with an object-storage service such as an S3-compatible bucket, and store only controlled object keys in the database.

## 8. Production checklist

Before go-live, configure HTTPS, use a private repository, replace the seed credentials, restrict database access, add database backups, configure persistent evidence storage, validate upload MIME types and size limits, review CSRF and session settings, apply institutional role approvals, and test the full incident workflow with authorized BUK stakeholders.

## 9. Branding assets

The BUK crest used by the interface is stored at `assets/buk-logo.png`. The UI theme uses the following palette:

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| BUK Blue | `#0B5C8E` | Primary actions, headings, active navigation |
| BUK Navy | `#06385B` | Sidebar gradients, hero backgrounds, dark surfaces |
| BUK Sky | `#0875B4` | Secondary emphasis and hover states |
| BUK Gold | `#C6A15B` | Institutional accent, active borders, highlights |
| BUK Gold Light | `#E4C777` | High-contrast accent text and subtle highlights |
| BUK Ink | `#071A2B` | Dark background and high-emphasis text |
